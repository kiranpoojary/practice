      <h1>CSS Units</h1>
    </div>
    <li>CSS has several different units for expressing a length.</li>
    <li>
      Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding,
      font-size, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.
    </li>
    <li>For some CSS properties, negative lengths are allowed.</li>
    <pre>
        h1 {
            font-size: 60px;
          }
          
        p {
            font-size: 25px;
            line-height: 50px;
          }

    Note: A whitespace cannot appear between the number and the unit. However, if the value is 0, the unit can be omitted.
    </pre>
    <h1>Absolute Lengths</h1>
    <li>
      The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these
      will appear as exactly that size.
    </li>
    <li>
      Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because
      screen sizes vary so much. However, they can be used if the output medium
      is known, such as for print layout.
    </li>

      <span style="font-weight: 900">NOTE:</span> * Pixels (px) are relative to
      the viewing device. For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel (dot) of
      the display. For printers and high resolution screens 1px implies multiple
      device pixels.

      <h1>Relative Lengths</h1>
      <li>
        Relative length units specify a length relative to another length
        property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering
        mediums.
      </li>
