      <h1>What is !important?</h1>
      <div>
        The !important rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a
        property/value than normal.
      </div>
      <div>
        In fact, if you use the !important rule, it will override ALL previous
        styling rules for that specific property on that element!
      </div>
      <h2>Example</h2>

      <p>This is some text in a paragraph.</p>

      <p class="myclass">This is some text in a paragraph.</p>

      <p id="myid">This is some text in a paragraph.</p>

      <div>
        In the above paragraph with class, id, and nothing has different
        background color but still all 3 show red background because the tag
        selectpr(p) set as important
      </div>
